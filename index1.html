            <h2>BIO</h2>
            <p> Sullivan was born on February 9, 1981, of Irish descent and raised Roman Catholic. He
                received his first pair of drumsticks at the age of five and his own drum set at the age of twelve.
                In high school, he started playing in bands. Before leaving to join Avenged Sevenfold as one of the
                band's founding members, Sullivan was the drummer for the third wave ska band Suburban Legends. At the
                age of 19, he recorded his first album with Avenged Sevenfold titled Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. His
                early influences included Frank Zappa and King Crimson. The Rev stated in an interview with Modern
                Drummer that he "was raised on that stuff as much as rock and metal."</p>

            <caption>"THE REV"</caption>

            <p> Later in life, he was influenced by drummers Vinnie Paul, Mike Portnoy (who would later be his fill-in
                with Avenged Sevenfold), Dave Lombardo, Lars Ulrich, and Terry Bozzio. Sullivan
                had a signature ability called "the double-ride thing" or "the Double Octopus", as the Rev called it,
                "just for lack of a better definition."The double-ride thing" is a technique that can be heard on
                tracks such as "Almost Easy", "Critical Acclaim", "Crossroads", and "Dancing Dead", in which Sullivan
                doubles up at a fast tempo between the double bass and ride cymbals.

                The Rev was the drummer, composer, songwriter, vocalist, and pianist for the band. His vocals are
                featured in several Avenged Sevenfold songs, including "Strength of the World", "Afterlife", "A Little
                Piece of Heaven", "Almost Easy", "Scream", "Critical Acclaim", "Lost", "Brompton Cocktail",
                "Crossroads", "Flash of the Blade" (Iron Maiden cover), "Art of Subconscious Illusion", "Save Me", and
                "Fiction". He also wrote and composed several songs for Avenged Sevenfold including "A Little Piece of
                Heaven", "Afterlife", "Almost Easy", "Unbound (The Wild Ride)", "Buried Alive", "Fiction", "Brompton
                Cocktail", "Welcome to the Family", "Save Me", among others. Avenged Sevenfold released a demo version
                of "Nightmare" featuring the Rev on an electronic drumset and providing some vocals.</p>

            <p> At the second annual Revolver Golden God Awards, the Rev won the award for "Best Drummer". His family
                members, and Avenged Sevenfold, received the posthumous honor on his behalf.

                In an Ultimate Guitar online readers' poll of the "Top Ten Greatest Drummers of All Time", the Rev
                appeared at No. 8, placing higher than Bill Ward of Black Sabbath and lower than Keith Moon of the Who.
                In 2017, he once again appeared in Ultimate Guitar's list of Top 25 Greatest Singing Drummers, at No.
                5.</p>

            <h2> DEATH </h2>
            <P>
                On December 28, 2009, the Rev was found unresponsive in his Huntington Beach home, and was later
                pronounced dead upon arrival to the hospital. Police ruled out foul play and noted that his death
                appeared to be from natural causes. An autopsy performed on December 30, 2009, was inconclusive, but
                toxicology results revealed to the public in June that he died from an overdose of oxycodone (Percocet),
                oxymorphone (a metabolite of oxycodone), diazepam (Valium), nordiazepam (a metabolite of diazepam), and
                alcohol. The coroner noted an enlarged heart as a "significant condition" that may have played a
                role in Sullivan's death.

                On January 6, 2010, a private funeral was held for Sullivan, who was then buried in The Good Shepherd
                Cemetery in Huntington Beach, California.Shortly after his death, Avenged Sevenfold dedicated their
                fifth studio album Nightmare to him, as well as several other songs, including "So Far Away", which had
                been
                written by bandmate (and childhood friend) Synyster Gates, and "Fiction", which the Rev had written
                three days before his death. M. Shadows and Gates stated in an interview to Hard Drive Radio: "The
                eeriest thing about it is there is a song on the album called 'Fiction' [a nickname the Rev gave
                himself which started out with the title 'Death.' And it was the last song The Rev wrote for the album,
                and when he handed it in, he said, 'That's it, that's the last song for this record.' And then, three
                days later, he died."
